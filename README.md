## What does it do?

It bans spam bots. If you've ever seen one of those comment reply bots that are heavily discouraged by the Reddit admins and API rules, then these are the bots BotTerminator bans. It serves the exact same function that /u/BotBust and /u/BotWatchman previously served.
A bot that I want in my sub is banned by BotTerminator! 

## Can I have it not check this bot?

Sure! Add either the class `btproof` to the user. `botbustproof` will also work, but it is considered deprecated and shouldn't be used.

## Could this be used to ban regular users?

It could, but it won't. If we messed up, please send a modmail, and we'll get it corrected right away.


## What are the permissions needed to run the bot?

You only need the `Access` and `Post` permissions as of now. (May change in the future)
